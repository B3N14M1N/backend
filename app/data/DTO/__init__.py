"""
Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for API request and response handling.

This module contains Pydantic models for:
- Request DTOs: Data coming into the API
- Response DTOs: Data sent back from the API
- Internal DTOs: Data transfer between layers

These DTOs provide:
- Input validation
- Type safety
- Clear API contracts
- Separation of concerns between API models and database models
